    "- GOAL\n",
    "    - Idle Capacity = (Actual tonnage - Normal Capcaity)/Normal Capacity\n",
    "    - Your task is to find out which of the 5 machines have exceeded this level and create a report for the executive stakeholders with your recommendations.\n",

    "    - With the difference calculation, you can choose relative to which difference you are comparing too. It can be next or even the first value!\n",
    "- Table Calculation: Are conducted after the aggregation\n",
    "- Calculated Field: Are conducted before the aggregation\n",
    "- At a very high level, MOST calculated fields are sent back as queries to the data source, so Tableau does not have to compute them at all -- instead, Excel, Access, MS SQL Server, or whatever data source you're using is providing the results via the query sent by Tableau.\n",
    "- Table Calculations happen locally, after the aggregate results are displayed on a viz in Tableau -- hence, the name \"Table Calculation\" (once you setup a table with something like SUM(Sales), you then can apply calculations to it very easily from a drop down menu on the measure).\n",
    "- Table Calculations (including the Quick Table Calculations) live in our Tableau View. They are created in the view and stay there, locally in our worksheet.\n",
    "- Calculated Fields are created on a data level and appear as a separate column in the data source. Tableau doesnâ€™t change the source, but can create an extract where the calculations will be visible."
