About:

If you have not taken Tableau A-Z, I suggest you take the course as it builds the foundation for this course. This course will help you solidified your knowledge in Tableau while providing tricks and tips to be a more efficient Tableau user.

The material in this course was more challenging than the introductory course. Yet, the challenge was the exciting part. The projects in this course will align what you will probably be doing in your professional career in Tableau. Till today, I used the projects as reference points.
